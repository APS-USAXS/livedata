TERSE EXPLANATION OF MAJOR CODE BLOCKS

Makefile
	--- calls starts/stops/restarts manage.csh

manage.csh
	--- starts/stops/restarts pvwatch.py
	--- sysAdmins could point to this from /etc/init.d or similar

pvwatch.py
	--- *** this is the main code of this "package" ***
	--- uses these resources
		pvlist.xml
		pvConnect.py
		livedata.xsl
		localConfig.py
		prjPySpec.py
		raw-table.xsl
		specplot.py
		wwwServerTransfers.py
	--- and generates files in /data/www/livedata
		index.html
		livedata.png
		raw-report.html
		report.xml
		specmacro.txt
	--- copies these to the XSD WWW server as they are generated

buildSpecPlots.sh
	--- uses these resources
		specplotsAllScans.py
		specplot.py
	--- and generates files and subdirs in
		/data/www/livedata/specplots
	--- rsyncs these to the XSD WWW server as they are generated
This script could be called from a cron job every 5 minutes or so.

dirWatch.py
	--- will probably go away - ignore it

NOTE
While many of the Python routines have code that executes 
when called directly from the command line, don't do this
unless you are CERTAIN of what will happen.  Some routines
change the local WWW dir and some even push files to the 
XSD WWW server.
